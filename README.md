# DS-ML-Project
> [!NOTE]
Final project in the last month of Data Science/Machine Learning class

## Project Description
This project is intended to produce a machine learning model to capable of accurately predicting if a student has ever overdrawn their checking account based on their age, gender, and how many days per month they drink (see [Features](#features)).

### Project Goals
- [ ] Explore and clean the dataset to prepare it for modelling
- [ ] Test different machine learning models to predict if overdrawn
- [ ] Compare the performance of the different models and choose the best one

## Data
The [project_data.csv](src/data/Project_Data.csv) dataset of 450 records with features of students' ages, genders, how many days per month they drink, and if they have ever overdrawn their checking account.
### Features
